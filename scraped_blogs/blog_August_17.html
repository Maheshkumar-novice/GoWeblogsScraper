It also covered <code>modulo</code> operator & <code>float</code> behaviour.</p><p>After that, the chapter covered the essential math required for the CP, like sum of N natural numbers, arithmetic progression, geomertric progression, logarithms, logic, sets, etc. It was definitely interesting to read and think about all those things.</p><p>Then the I&rsquo;ve started reading the <code>Time Complexity</code> chapter where it covered the basics of it and a few example notations generally used. Then I&rsquo;ve explored the problem demonstration for time complexity - <code>Maximum subarray sum</code> problem. They&rsquo;ve covered 3 algorithms of different time complexity and explained how they differ. It was interesting.</p><p>Now I&rsquo;ve started reading the <code>Sorting</code> chapter. Should I try the given example problem myself? I think no need because that is already solved. It&rsquo;ll essentially a rewrite. So no.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll try the sort theory parts in code so that I&rsquo;ll get some understanding. That&rsquo;ll also make my understanding more clear.</p><p>Once this chapter is over I&rsquo;ll review what I&rsquo;ve learned so far and try to solve few problems in LeetCode or NeetCode. After that I&rsquo;ll proceed.</p><p>Okay. I got distracted and solved a couple of problems in leet code just to implement <code>merge sort</code> and <code>counting sort</code>. I&rsquo;ve put the code <a href=https://github.com/Maheshkumar-novice/LeetCode>here</a>.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll review the sorting chapter once again and try to implement the sort algos in C++ and then I&rsquo;ll move on to the next thing in the chapter.</p><p>Couldn&rsquo;t get the hands on <code>scrapy</code> today. I&rsquo;ll try put some time on it next time. Want to do something with <code>defcord</code> also but couldn&rsquo;t get enough time. Let&rsquo;s see.</p><p>That&rsquo;s all for today.</p></content><p><a class=blog-tags href=/GoWeblogs/tags/daily/>#daily</a></p></main><footer><small>Maheshkumar | Made with <a href=https://github.com/clente/hugo-bearcub>Bear Cub</a></small></footer></body></html>
